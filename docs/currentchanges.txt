V3.0 of softconsole is now available.  This is the completion of some major changes that allow the console to operate with ISY and Home Assistant hubs.  A single console can connect with multiple hubs (multiple ISYs, multiple HAs, or a combination of both).  The Home Assistant support includes support for Nest thermostats via HA and probably supports other units since it uses the standard HA climate interface but hasn't been tested with units other than Nest.  It also moves to a fully cached state model which makes entering a new screen slightly faster.  While no instance of the state being out of sync between the hub and console has been seen there is an alert proc available that can be run periodically (e.g., once or twice a day) to verify the cached state correctness.  Existing config files should be compatible but there is a new format to support multiple hubs.  Also added is support for a hub becoming unavailable for some period of time due to reboots, network issues, etc.  Key screen with keys corresponding to unavailable nodes now display as unusable.

V3.01 is a minor bug fix/cleanup release.  The main addition is a minimalist version of the install script meant to be used with the "stretch-lite" Raspbian distribution on Pi0 systems.  It doesn't install VNC so only ssh access to the finished system is available.  This release fixes a few odd timing race conditions that sometimes led to anomalous log messages.  It also has a patch to handle junk forecasts from WeatherUnderground that seem to be somewhat common of late.  This is where they return a "forecast" for Jan 3, 2018.  The console suppresses these and just continues to use the last good forecast for display (or an error message if none such exists).
