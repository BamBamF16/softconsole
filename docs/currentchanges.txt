V3.0 of softconsole is now available.  This is the completion of some major changes that allow the console to operate with ISY and Home Assistant hubs.  A single console can connect with multiple hubs (multiple ISYs, multiple HAs, or a combination of both).  The Home Assistant support includes support for Nest thermostats via HA and probably supports other units since it uses the standard HA climate interface but hasn't been tested with units other than Nest.  It also moves to a fully cached state model which makes entering a new screen slightly faster.  While no instance of the state being out of sync between the hub and console has been seen there is an alert proc available that can be run periodically (e.g., once or twice a day) to verify the cached state correctness.  Existing config files should be compatible but there is a new format to support multiple hubs.  Also added is support for a hub becoming unavailable for some period of time due to reboots, network issues, etc.  Key screen with keys corresponding to unavailable nodes now display as unusable.

V3.01 is a minor bug fix/cleanup release.  The main addition is a minimalist version of the install script meant to be used with the "stretch-lite" Raspbian distribution on Pi0 systems.  It doesn't install VNC so only ssh access to the finished system is available.  This release fixes a few odd timing race conditions that sometimes led to anomalous log messages.  It also has a patch to handle junk forecasts from WeatherUnderground that seem to be somewhat common of late.  This is where they return a "forecast" for Jan 3, 2018.  The console suppresses these and just continues to use the last good forecast for display (or an error message if none such exists).

V3.1 of softconsole adds a number of new/updated capabilities.  Of most importance is weather support.  WeatherUnderground has become increasingly flakey as a provider and they have now announced that will drop support for their current API at the end of the year (they claim they may replace it with a new personal API but have no details at this point).  As a result the release adds support for an additional weather provider, APIXU, who provides free weather for personal, limited use (10000 calls/month).  Structurally the program has actually separated the weather provider part from the rest of the weather support logic so it would be straightforward to add other providers by modeling them after the apixustore.py file.  (Basically, this code simply has to map the, typically JSON, returned by a provider to a standard form of naming using elsewhere in the console.)  Unfortunately, adding this support made it too difficult to maintain backward compatibility of the config file so you will need to update yours even if you are using WU by adding section(s) to define weather provider(s) and sections to define internal location names from which weather is to be fetched and map to the provider's location code.  See the example auth.cfg, weathersources.cfg, and any weather cfg file for example of how this works.  The WU proveder has been made more robust in an effort to deal with the WU flakiness in the meantime (things like missing sky conditions, out of date data, stations gone missing, etc.)

Some other changes:
- This release also updates Home Assistant support for their new authentication regime (post 0.77 of HA).  Use their access tokens and supply that as the password.  A small added feature is the display of a small light (unobtrusive) dot in the upper right of the display if a Warning or Error level entry has been made in the log file since the log was last looked at.  Accessing the log from the maintenance screen clears the indicator.
- Two new screen types have been added that will probably not be of interest to anyone other than me that support Octoprint (a manager for 3D printers) and Sonos systems.  The Sonos screen depends upon Home Assistant running.
- The termshortenlist has been moved to the Console directory (where as a config type file it really belonged) for :
- As always lots of little bug fixes throughout.

V3.11 is a very minor clean up from 3.1.  It fixes some benign error reports that didn't belong in the code.  It also continues to imporve some of the communication error reports that can occur when packets get dropped between hubs and the console.  A general improvement is that when you access the maintenance log when there is an outstanding "error in the log" indicator (see 3.1 release) the console auto pages to the first unseen Warning or higher message in the log.  For Home Assistant hubs it handles a few more types of node report messages without logging them as anomolous and fixes issues with running HA scripts from a console key.

V3.2 is a notable release that will mainly be of interest if running more than one console.  Its major addition is the use of MQTT when configured to allow multiple consoles to report their operational status and to coordinate any Warning or Error level log entries.  This permits the user to look at the log on any single console and see any serious log entries made by all the consoles in the house.  It also coordinates the on-screen error indicator across consoles.  It allows a simple look at the current status of all running consoles, as well as the hardware/software of the systems they are running on.  Finally, it allows external issuing of commands to all or specific consoles via an MQTT publish.  These additions were motivated by my personal experience running 8 consoles across 2 homes.  This version  also moves all major system and screen parameters to the store model which makes them accessible to as screen configuration and alert parameters as well as via the MQTT set mechanism.  In addition to this (which is only enables if you configure MQTT so not an issue if you don't) there are a lot of improvements in error handling of various ISY and HomeAssistant error cases.  In particular, the console will now initiate an ISY query when it sees an ISY node with a communications error (motivater by a particular issue I had with my garage door opener).  It also notes error conditions that clear as well as prolonged ISY busy periods (expect one at the overnight daily whole house query).  In general, error messages have been cleaned up to avoid pointless Warning level messages where possible.  Finally, some additional diagnostic capabilities were added to allow dumping of the history of events that led up to a situation.  This version also deprecates WeatherUnderground support completely since it will be killed off by them at end of month.  All the above has been added to the documentation.

V3.2.1 is a very minor bug fix release.  It improves some error handling for the new APIXU weather service reports, supports LocationSize = 0 directive for weatherscreens (like it does for timetemp screens), avoids extraneous log messages for users running node servers on V3 ISY firmware, and allows SSL connection to an ISY using self generated keys (actually by turning off SSL certificate validation).  It also includes some internal structural cleanups that should have no visible impacts.
