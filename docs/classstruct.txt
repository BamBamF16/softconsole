Class/Attribute Structure:

object: [ISY, OnOffItem, TouchPoint, ScreenDesc]
The most base type
    ISY: []
    
	Singleton object (1 per console) that represents the ISY system as a whole and provides roots to its structures
	and useful directories to its nodes/programs.  Provides a debug method to dump the constructed graph.
	Note current limitation: assumes non-conflicting names at the leaves.  Qualified name support is a future addition.

        ManualKeyDesc: [RunThenKey, OnOffKey]
        
	Defines a drawn touchable rectangle on the screen that represents a key (button).  May be called with one of 2
	signatures.  It can be called manually by code to create a key by supplying all the attributes of the key in the
	code explicitly.  It can also be called with a config objects section in which case it will build the key from the
	combination of the defaults for the attributes and the explicit overides found in the config.txt file section
	that is passed in.
